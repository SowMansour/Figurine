# Figurine

## What is the goal of the Figurine project :thinking:

"Figurine" is a project designed to facilitate the manipulation of data within a database. In the development of this project, I have employed a range of technologies and methodologies to ensure its robustness and efficiency. Here are some of the key components used:

- MVC Architecture: To maintain a clean and organized codebase, I've adopted the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Currently, the model is represented by the dataMapper, which handles the data-related operations.

- Express.js Module: Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, serves as the backbone of this project. It simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, routing, and middleware integration.

- EJS Template: For rendering dynamic content, I've chosen EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates. EJS provides an elegant way to structure and present data to users.

- PostgreSQL: Figurine relies on PostgreSQL as its primary database management system. PostgreSQL is known for its reliability and robust features, making it an excellent choice for data storage and retrieval.

- Static Files: To enhance the user experience, all static files, including stylesheets, scripts, and assets, are neatly organized within the 'Integration' directory.

By combining these components, Figurine aims to provide a seamless and efficient platform for data manipulation and presentation.
